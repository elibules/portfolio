      Hi! My name is <span class="green">Elijah Bules</span>, a
      <span class="red">Full Stack Developer</span>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Originally from the cornfields of Northwest Indiana, I moved down to
      Indianapolis in the Fall of 2020 to study Web Development. I'm currently a
      Senior at Indiana University - Purdue University Indianapolis seeking a
      Bachelor of Science in both Media Arts and Science as well as Informatics,
      and I am graduating in May of 2023. These two majors combined create the
      Full Stack Development course of study at IUPUI.<br /><br />
      I've had the great opportunity to be a Teaching Assistant for two classes that
      cover all things PHP, MySQL, and JavaScript related. It is also at IUPUI that I
      got the chance to work on a research project for the School of Medicine written in PHP.
      In the Spring of 2023, I started work at KPaul as a Student Software Engineer working
      with the C#/ASP.NET MVC Platform. 
      <br /><br />
      I would list my current hard-skills as follows:
    </p>
    <div class="skills">
      <ul>
        <li>PHP</li>
        <li>C#/.NET</li>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>HTML/CSS/SCSS</li>
        <li>jQuery</li>
        <li>MySQL</li>
        <li>JSON</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>React.JS</li>
        <li>Object-Oriented Programming</li>
        <li>MVC Architecture</li>
        <li>RESTful APIs</li>
        <li>Linux Systems</li>
        <li>General Design</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
      However, I believe that with my desire to learn new technologies and
      skills, and a solid understanding of core programming principles, I am up
      for any challenge outside of what I say I might be comfortable with.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks for reading <br />
