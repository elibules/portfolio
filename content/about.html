      Hi! My name is <span class="green">Elijah Bules</span>, a
      <span class="red">Full Stack Developer</span>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Originally from the cornfields of Northwest Indiana, I moved down to
      Indianapolis in the Fall of 2020 to study Web Development. I'm currently a
      Senior at Indiana University - Purdue University Indianapolis seeking a
      Bachelor of Science in both Media Arts and Science as well as Informatics,
      and I am graduating in May of 2023. These two majors combined create the
      Full Stack Development course of study at IUPUI.<br /><br />
      While at IUPUI, I've had the great opportunity of being a Teaching
      Assistant for two classes in the Fall of 2022 that cover all things PHP,
      MySQL, JavaScript related. Having already taken them, being present in
      those two classes once again helped reinforce my own knowledge of those
      technologies, but I have found that helping and aiding my fellow students
      has been the best way to further my understanding. This experience has
      also greatly improved my ability to effectively communicate in general.
      <br /><br />
      I would list my current hard-skills as follows:
    </p>
    <div class="skills">
      <ul>
        <li>PHP</li>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>HTML/CSS/SCSS</li>
        <li>jQuery</li>
        <li>MySQL</li>
        <li>JSON</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>React</li>
        <li>Object-Oriented Programming</li>
        <li>MVC Architecture</li>
        <li>RESTful APIs</li>
        <li>Linux Systems</li>
        <li>General Design</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
      However, I believe that with my desire to learn new technologies and
      skills, and a solid understanding of core programming principles, I am up
      for any challenge outside of what I say I might be comfortable with.<br />
      <br />
      Thanks for reading <br />
